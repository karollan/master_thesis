The use of artificial intelligence to create dialogues in video games

This thesis aims was to analyze existing artificial intelligence technologies, particularly large
language models, for their use in creating non-player character dialogues in video games, and
to design and implement a prototype game in which dialogues will be generated using artificial
intelligence tools that enable natural language conversations. The video game was made using
the Unity game development engine, and the GPT-4o large language model created and provided
by OpenAI was used to manage the dialogues. The evaluation of the quality of the dialogues
generated by the model was done by surveying users in the form of a questionnaire taken after

playing the game, to assess their experience of interacting with artificial intelligence-powered non-
player characters.
